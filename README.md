## To Install Essentials
1. Install CamTwist_3.4.3.dmg if on MacOS. If on Windows, for right now I'm trying to find alternatives.
2. Install a non-Commercial copy of TouchDesigner from the TouchDesigner website.
3. Open the most recent ForumVidExample.toe file, it will be the one with the highest digit after it.
4. Press F1 to enter Perform Mode to start running the patch. You may have to press spacebar if things are paused in Touch.
5. Open CamTwist.
5. In Camtwist, Select your CamTwist source as "Syphon", and under Syphon Server select "TouchDesigner"
6. Open your video conferencing service as select CamTwist as your source instead of your normal webcam under video settings.
7. If you would like to record an improvisation's video stream, download the SyphonRecorder.zip, unpack, and install it. This simple interface allows you to quick record any Syphon steam you have.
